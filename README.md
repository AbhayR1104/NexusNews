NexusNews is a sophisticated, AI-powered chatbot built with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It fetches real-time news articles on any given topic, processes the content, and allows users to ask specific, nuanced questions. The entire pipeline is built using open-source models, making it a powerful and cost-effective solution for on-demand information retrieval.

This project was developed as a portfolio piece to showcase skills in AI, data engineering, and Python development.
